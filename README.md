# Evan's Crafting Bench (aka dotfiles)
Configuration and setup for the tools and utilities I use regularly.

- vim
- tmux
- zsh
- typography

## Installation
Simply run ./install

This take-anywhere configuration works on Linux and Mac OSX
The installation will:
- Install key software using either apt-get or mac-ports
- Install a tweaked out vim
- Install zsh
- Symlink dotfiles to this directory
